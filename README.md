# Election_Analysis_Challenge

## Project Overview
A Colorado board of Elections employee has given me the following task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election
- The Voter turnout for each county.
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

## Resources

- Data Source : election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.7
- VIsual Code Studio 1.50.1

## Results

1.	The total votes that were cast in this congressional election was 369,711.
2.	The break down of the total number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct are:
    - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
    - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
    - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
3.	Denver had the largest number of votes
4.	The break down of the total number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each candidate are:
    - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
    - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
5.	Diana DeGette won the election he secured 272.892 votes and a percentage vote of 73.8%

## Election Audit Summary

- Since this code was used to analyse the election results of just 3 counties and 3 candidates, I think it can also be used for a broader scope like Election results of all states and all candidates. 
- The Only modification it will need is an addition of code of ‘for’ loop to select every state first and then analyse the candidates and county for that state coming up with results for each state separately. 
- And at the end a consolidated report of the party winning the election in the country and the seats won by each party state wise. 
- This can be achieved by declaring a variable and using it to add the votes from all the states for each political party and then dividing it by total votes to get the percentage of votes won by each.
